      <description>I host my own static website on Azure Storage, and I got tired of running a script to upload my content every time I made a change to my website. After some Googling, I discovered GitHub Actions, made public about a month ago, which lets users automate how they build, test, and deploy their projects. Interestingly, though I found great guides for automating static website deployment to Azure using GitLab and building and deploying Gatsby sites with GitHub Actions, there wasnâ€™t one guide with everything I needed, and I had to cobble pieces together from different sources.</description>
